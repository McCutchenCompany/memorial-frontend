      <h3>Create a lasting tribute to your loved ones.</h3>
      <p>
        Memorials include images, videos, an interactive timeline
        of life events, and a place for others to share their
        memories of the individual being remembered. Just like
        a physical memorial, your digital memorial is placed
        wherever you want in the world for others to see. Using
        the map on our search page, anyone near your memorial
        will be able to view it. A one time purchase gives you
        access to our editor, where you can easily create and
        modify the memorial to honor your loved one. We
        don't mean to forget, and now you never will.

            <h5>Share Memories</h5>
            <p>
              Memorial provides a place for anyone to share memories of who your
              loved one was. Every memory added paints a deeper picture of the
              life you want to remember. Sharing the memorial on social media
              is a great way to let others know they can begin adding theirs too.
              As the memorial owner you decide if you want to approve the memories
              before they are displayed, or if anyone can post their memories
              without having to wait for your approval.

          <p>
            You decide where the memorial should be located. It can be placed
            digitally anywhere in the world for people to view from their phones,
            tablets, or computers. Anyone near your memorial will see it displayed
            on their search page under "Memorials near you". Imagine placing it
            at their final resting place and instead of visitors seeing a name
            and a couple of dates, they are able to see a glimpse into the life
            of your loved one.

          <p>
            Create an interactive timeline celebrating your loved one's life.
            Each life event you add helps tell their story as photos
            and videos bring it to life. Visitors will be able to click through
            each event and be transported back in time as they read about
            his/her experiences. What better way for future generations to connect
            with those that came before.

      <h3>Shared Photo Album</h3>
      <p>
        Each Memorial has a shared photo album where anyone can upload photos.
        Now, there is one safe place where all of the photos of your loved one
        can live, without the worry of fires, floods, theft, or any other life
        events ruining the physical copies. Since anyone can upload their
        pictures, you'll be sure to see some that you didn't know existed!
        Each Memorial owner can decide if they need to review the photos
        before they are published.
